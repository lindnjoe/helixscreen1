## Current Priorities

### 1. Input Shaper Implementation

**Status:** Stub panel exists, awaiting implementation

The Input Shaper panel currently shows a "Coming Soon" overlay. Implementation requires:
- Integration with Klipper's `input_shaper` module
- Graphing `SHAPER_CALIBRATE` results (frequency response)
- Recommended shaper selection UI
- Apply/revert workflow

**Files:** `src/ui_panel_input_shaper.cpp`, `ui_xml/input_shaper_panel.xml`

### 2. Plugin Ecosystem

**Status:** Core infrastructure complete, expanding ecosystem

The plugin system launched with version checking, UI injection points, and async execution.

**Next steps:**
- [ ] LED Effects plugin → production quality
- [ ] Additional plugin examples for community
- [ ] Plugin documentation refinement

**Files:** `src/plugin_manager.cpp`, `docs/PLUGIN_DEVELOPMENT.md`

### 3. Production Hardening

Remaining items for production readiness:
- [ ] Structured logging with log rotation
- [ ] Edge case testing (print failures, filesystem errors)
- [ ] Streaming file operations verified on AD5M with 50MB+ G-code files

### 4. Bed Mesh Renderer Refactor

**Status:** Phases 1-4 complete, 5-7 remaining

Decomposing the 2,243-line god-file into modular architecture:
- Rasterizer, Overlays, Geometry, Clipping modules
- Target: 1,450 lines total with single-responsibility modules

See `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` for detailed phase breakdown.

## What's Complete

### Core Architecture
- LVGL 9.4 with declarative XML layouts
- Reactive Subject-Observer data binding
- Design token system (no hardcoded colors/spacing)
- RAII lifecycle management (PanelBase, ObserverGuard, SubscriptionGuard)
- Theme system with dark/light modes
- Responsive breakpoints (small/medium/large displays)

### Panels & Features
- **30 Production Panels:** Home, Controls, Motion, Print Status, Print Select, Settings, Advanced, Macros, Console, Power, Print History, Spoolman, AMS, Bed Mesh, PID Calibration, Z-Offset, Screws Tilt, Extrusion, Filament, Temperature panels, and more
- **10+ Overlays:** WiFi, Timelapse Settings, Firmware Retraction, Machine Limits, Fan Control, Exclude Object, Print Cancel Confirmation, Print Complete, and more
- **First-Run Wizard:** WiFi → Moonraker → Printer ID → Heaters → Fans → LEDs → Summary

### Multi-Material (AMS)
- 5 backend implementations: Happy Hare, AFC-Klipper, ValgACE, Toolchanger, Mock
- Spool visualization with 3D-style gradients and animations
- Spoolman integration (6 API methods: list spools, assign, consume, etc.)
- Print color requirements display from G-code metadata
- External spool bypass support

### Plugin System
- Dynamic plugin loading with version compatibility checking
- UI injection points for extensibility
- Thread-safe async plugin execution
- Settings UI for plugin discovery and management
- LED Effects proof-of-concept plugin

### Moonraker Integration
- WebSocket client with auto-reconnection
- JSON-RPC protocol with timeout management
- 40+ API methods: print control, motion, heaters, fans, LEDs, power devices, print history, timelapse, screws tilt, firmware retraction, machine limits, Spoolman

### Build System
- Parallel builds (`make -j`)
- Docker cross-compilation for Pi (aarch64) and AD5M (armv7-a)
- Pre-commit hooks (clang-format, quality checks)
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- Icon font generation with validation

## Backlog (Lower Priority)

| Feature | Effort | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| **Lazy panel initialization** | Medium | Defer `init_subjects()` until first nav; blocked on LVGL XML subject timing |
| **Camera/Webcam** | Low | Lower priority for local touchscreen use case |
| **Client-side thumbnails** | Low | Fallback when Moonraker doesn't provide (USB symlinked files) |
| **mDNS discovery** | Low | Auto-find Moonraker; manual IP works fine |
| **NULL → nullptr cleanup** | Low | Consistency across C++ codebase |
| **Belt tension visualization** | Future | Controlled excitation + stroboscopic LED feedback |
| **OTA updates** | Future | Currently requires manual binary update |

See `docs/IDEAS.md` for additional ideas and design rationale.

## Known Technical Debt

See `docs/ARCHITECTURAL_DEBT.md` for the full register.

**Key items:**
- **PrinterState god class** (1514 lines, 194 methods) → decompose into domain objects
- **PrintStatusPanel** (2983 lines) → extract PrintJobController, PrintDisplayModel
- **Singleton cascade pattern** → UIPanelContext value object
- **Code duplication** → SubjectManagedPanel base class, DEFINE_GLOBAL_PANEL macro

---

## Design Philosophy

HelixScreen is a **local touchscreen** UI - users are physically present at the printer. This fundamentally differs from web UIs (Mainsail/Fluidd) designed for remote monitoring.

**We prioritize:**
- Tactile controls optimized for touch
- At-a-glance information for the user standing at the machine
- Calibration workflows (PID, Z-offset, screws tilt, input shaper)
- Real-time tuning (speed, flow, firmware retraction)

**Lower priority for this form factor:**
- Camera (you can see the printer with your eyes)
- Job queue (requires manual print removal between jobs)
- Remote monitoring features

See `docs/IDEAS.md` § "Design Philosophy: Local vs Remote UI" for full rationale.

## Target Platforms

| Platform | Architecture | Status |
|----------|--------------|--------|
| **Raspberry Pi 4/5** | aarch64 | Docker cross-compile |
| **BTT Pad** | aarch64 | Same as Pi |
| **Adventurer 5M** | armv7-a | Static linking (glibc 2.25) |
| **macOS** | x86_64/ARM64 | SDL2 development |
| **Linux** | x86_64 | SDL2, CI/CD tested |
