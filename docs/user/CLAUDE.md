# docs/user/CLAUDE.md — User Documentation

These docs are **end-user facing**. They must be written for people who are NOT developers — clear language, no implementation details, no source code references.

## Style Rules

- Write for someone who just bought a Raspberry Pi and a touchscreen
- Use step-by-step instructions with exact commands
- Screenshots are better than descriptions
- Never reference source files, class names, or internal architecture
- Config examples should be copy-pasteable
- When mentioning settings, show the exact path in the UI (e.g., "Settings > Advanced > Beta Features")
- Test all instructions on a clean install before publishing
