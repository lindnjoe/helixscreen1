/**
 * @brief macOS Ethernet backend implementation
 *
 * Uses libhv's cross-platform ifconfig() utility to enumerate network
 * interfaces and detect Ethernet connectivity.
 *
 * Interface detection strategy:
 * - Filters for Ethernet interfaces (en1, en2, en3, etc.)
 * - Excludes loopback and common WiFi interfaces (en0 on some Macs)
 * - Returns first interface with valid IP address
 * - Falls back to any en* interface if found
 *
 * Note: macOS network interfaces are named differently from Linux:
 * - en0: Often WiFi (but sometimes Ethernet on Mac Minis/iMacs)
 * - en1, en2, en3: Typically Thunderbolt/USB Ethernet adapters
 * - en4+: Additional adapters
