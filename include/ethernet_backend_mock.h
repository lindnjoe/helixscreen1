/**
 * @brief Mock Ethernet backend for simulator and testing
 *
 * Provides fake Ethernet functionality with static data:
 * - Always reports interface as available
 * - Returns fixed IP address (192.168.1.150)
 * - Connected status
 * - Fake MAC address
 *
 * Perfect for:
 * - macOS/simulator development
 * - UI testing without real Ethernet hardware
 * - Automated testing scenarios
 * - Fallback when platform backends fail
